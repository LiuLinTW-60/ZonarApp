	 * Creates a new 3D rotation on the Y axis. The rotation is defined by its
	 * start angle and its end angle. Both angles are in degrees. The rotation
	 * is performed around a center point on the 2D space, definied by a pair of
	 * X and Y coordinates, called centerX and centerY. When the animation
	 * starts, a translation on the Z axis (depth) is performed. The length of
	 * the translation can be specified, as well as whether the translation
	 * should be reversed in time.
